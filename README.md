# Weave Starter Kit

This is a simple app to show how to build an application
using the weave framework. Feel free to copy this repo
to start your own application.

Before starting with this code (or while you do so), you may well want to check
out the documentation at https://weave.readthedocs.io, which presents many
of the high-level concepts you need to understand in order to code.

You will probably want to clone http://github.com/iov-one/weave and
keep this in another folder in your IDE for reference. Or, maybe you
find [godocs](http://godoc.org/github.com/iov-one/weave) more helpful.

## Running the demo app

**TODO**

## Using for your own app.

You can copy or fork this repo. You will want to rename it to your proper path and then
do a search and replace for `iov-one/weave-starter-kit` with your github project name.
In particular:

* prototool.yaml (import path)
* all files in `cmd/mycoind`

You will want to rename `mycoind` to the desired name of your application (chain).
And then extend it. It is just a simple scaffolding to give the entry points into
setting up an application and make it less daunting for developers.
